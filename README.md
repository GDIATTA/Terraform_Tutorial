# Terraform_Tutorial
Terraform, tool of Infrastructure as Code(IaaC) allow you to manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. Also the best of this tool is his human-readable configuration language. 


## ----------------- What is Infrastructure as Code with Terraform? ------------------
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.
IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share. <br>

Terraform is HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure's lifecycle. Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure: <br>
> Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms. <br>
> The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly. <br>
> Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments. <br>
> You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure. <br>
