# Terraform_Tutorial
Terraform, tool of Infrastructure as Code(IaaC) allow you to manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. Also the best of this tool is his human-readable configuration language. 


## ----------------- What is Infrastructure as Code with Terraform? ------------------
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.
IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share. <br>

Terraform is HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure's lifecycle. Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure: <br>
> Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms. <br>
> The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly. <br>
> Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments. <br>
> You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure. <br>

#### 1. Manage any infrastructure
Terraform plugins called providers let Terraform interact with cloud platforms and other services via their application programming interfaces (APIs). HashiCorp and the Terraform community have written over 1,000 providers to manage resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub, Splunk, and DataDog, just to name a few. Find providers for many of the platforms and services you already use in the Terraform Registry. If you don't find the provider you're looking for, you can write your own. <br>
